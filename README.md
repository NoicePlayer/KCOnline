# KCOnline
My friend's physical card game, Kingdom Conqueror, p2p!

You have to download and run [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/download/ahk-v2.exe) to run this script, but this can be done w/o admin.

Once you have downloaded and extracted, simply run KCgame.ahk, and follow the in-game instructions. There is a link to [KingdomConquerors.com](KingdomConqueror.weebly.com) in game, which demonstrates how to play.

You may have to [port forward](https://www.noip.com/support/knowledgebase/general-port-forwarding-guide) as the host, if you are not connecting on the same network. (Most ISPs will have an easier way through their app or something)

Please be delicate! For best gameplay experience don't do anything! It will break without warning or error!
If this happens, you can try to restart by pressing `esc` and returning to menu.

If it ever does have an error, relaunching the script or selecting `Reload` from the error menu should do the trick.

# Card Creator
There is also a card creator mini-app, but it is not *fully* implemented, you can use it to create cards visually, but it will not show up in game.
